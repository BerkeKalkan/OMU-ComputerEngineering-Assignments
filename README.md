## Data Structures
* [Week 3](https://github.com/BerkeKalkan/OMU-ComputerEngineering-Assignments/tree/master/Data_Structures_BIL203/Week3/)

  Create a sorted Linked-List structure:
  
  * Nodes should have a studentNumber integer, studentName string(array of chars) and a pointer for the next student.
  * Create addStudent, deleteStudent, printStudentList and getNumberOfStudents functions.

  Create a Queue structure:
  
  * Nodes should have a studentNumber integer, studentName string(array of chars) and a pointer for the next student.
  * Create queueStudent, dequeueStudent and printQueue functions.
  
* [Week 5](https://github.com/BerkeKalkan/OMU-ComputerEngineering-Assignments/tree/master/Data_Structures_BIL203/Week5/)

  Create a Binary search tree structure where the data is an integer:
  
  * Nodes should have a data integer and two pointers for left and right child tree nodes.
  * Create insertTreeNode, inorderTraversal, postorderTraversal, preorderTraversal, findTreeMaximum and findTreeMinimum functions.
